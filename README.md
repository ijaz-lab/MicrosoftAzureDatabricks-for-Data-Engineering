Microsoft Azure Databricks for Data Engineering
In this course you will develop an understanding of the Azure Databricks platform and know how to take advantage of its capabilities and those of the Apache Spark notebook to process large amounts of data. You will also be able to identify suitable tasks for Apache Spark.

Course syllabus
In this course you will learn about Microsoft Azure Databricks for Data Engineering.

Module 1: Introduction to Azure Databricks
In the first module of this course, you will learn how Azure Databricks works with Apache Spark notebook. You will explore Azure Databricks workspace, Apache Spark clusters and Apache Spark engine jobs, taking a deep-dive into their key features and architecture. You will then undertake an exercise to create an Azure Databricks workspace and host a notebook within it.

Module 2: Read and write data in Azure Databricks
The second module in this course introduces you to the different types of data that you can read and write with Azure Databricks, including CSV, JSON and Parquet. Once you develop familiarity with reading and writing these data types, you will then use the platform to combine inputs from files and data stores, as well as transform and store the data for advanced analytics.

Module 3: Data processing in Azure Databricks
In this module you will learn how to work with DataFrames in Azure Databricks. The module will explore the basics of DataFrames, and review the various methods and functions they offer for working with data. You will also engage with performance features in Azure Databricks, including the Catalyst Optimizer.

Module 4: Work with DataFrames in Azure Databricks
In this fourth module, you will work with DataFrames columns in Azure Databricks, exploring basic features such as column class and expressions, alongside more advanced methods such as how to manipulate date and time values, or aggregate functions.

Module 5: Platform architecture, security, and data protection in Azure Databricks
In this module you will explore the Azure Databricks platform architecture, with particular emphasis on the data protection, secure access and storage features. You will also learn how to access Azure Storage with key vault-backed secrets.

Module 6: Delta Lake
This module focuses on the Delta Lake service. You will learn about its basic functionality and architecture, alongside its key features and use cases. After developing familiarity with the basics of the service, you will then build and query a Delta Lake, as well as perform optimization.

Module 7: Analyze streaming data and create production workloads
Module seven serves as an introduction to the key features and use cases of Structured Streaming. You will learn how to stream, write and aggregate data via Structured Streaming, as well as apply watermarking and connect to Event Hubs. You will also work with Azure Data Factory to create production workloads, manage notebooks and parameters, and monitor pipelines.

Module 8: Create a data architecture
In module eight you will explore data architecture by using Azure DevOps with the CI/CD process to build release pipelines. You will also discover how to integrate Azure Databricks with other services by using the SQL Data Warehouse connector. Finally, you will develop familiarity with our best practices for working with the Azure Databricks platform.

Module 9: Practice Exam on Data engineering with Azure Databricks
In the final module, you will take a practice exam that covers key skills measured in the Exam DP-203: Data engineering with Azure Databricks. After completing this module you will understand 1) how the Azure Databricks platform works, 2) how to take advantage of its capabilities and those of the Apache Spark notebook to process large amounts of data. 3) And you will also be able to identify suitable tasks for Apache Spark.

Practical Exercises 
This course includes practical exercises. We encourage you to complete these exercises. They help you gain further knowledge of Microsoft Azure Databricks. Completing the exercises gives you a more practical understanding on how to explore Azure Databricks. This hands-on approach will help you in your preparation for the exam
